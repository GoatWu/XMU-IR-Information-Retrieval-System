Raptors, Clark Agree To Make Him An Unresticted Free Agent

(July 22, 2002) -- The Toronto Raptors announced Monday they have rescinded their qualifying offer to restricted free-agent forward/centre Keon Clark, making him unrestricted under the rules of the collective bargaining agreement. Teams have the option to recall any previous offer by July 23. 

“Withdrawing our qualifying offer best serves the interests of Keon Clark as well as the Raptors,?said Glen Grunwald, senior vice-president and general manager. “We appreciate the contributions he has made to our organization, and this will enable him to pursue the best possible opportunity without being encumbered by being a restricted free agent. 

“At the same time, with the announcement of a decrease in the league’s salary cap for next season, it is critical that we put together the best possible team now while maintaining flexibility to also improve along the way within the framework of the luxury tax. Although it’s unlikely, rescinding the offer to Keon does not preclude us from re-signing him, or working out a sign-and-trade with another team.? 

The Raptors made a qualifying offer to Clark on June 28 making him a restricted free agent. Clark would have become an unrestricted free agent July 1 had the Raptors not tendered an offer. As a restricted free agent, a player can receive contract offers from other teams, but his current team has the right to match and keep his services. As an unrestricted free agent, a player is free to sign with any team. 

Clark, a four-year NBA veteran, averaged 11.3 points and 7.4 rebounds during the 2001-02 season.
