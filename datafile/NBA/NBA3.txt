Raptors Sign Dial For Season

(April 7, 2002) --The Toronto Raptors announced Sunday they have signed guard Derrick Dial to a contract for the remainder of the 2001-02 season. The Raptors signed Dial to a 10-day contract March 28. 

At the expiration of the first 10-day contract, in accordance with league rules, the Raptors had the option to sign Dial to a contract for the remainder of the season, sign him to a second 10-day contract or place him on waivers. 

Because the Raptors currently have a league maximum of three players on the injured list, the team has been granted a roster exemption by the NBA under the special hardship rule. The rule allows a team with three players on its injured list to substitute an active player if another player misses a minimum of three consecutive games due to injury. 

Vince Carter, who had arthroscopic surgery March 26 on his left knee, will remain on the active roster. The special hardship ruling permits the Raptors?active roster to consist of 13 players for the regular season, one more than the league limit. Currently Tracy Murray (back spasms), Mamadou N’diaye (right foot plantar fasciitis) and Michael Stewart (hernia) are on the club’s injured list. 

Dial has scored 11 points in 14 minutes in his two appearances with the Raptors. He tallied nine points in seven minutes in Friday’s victory at Chicago.
