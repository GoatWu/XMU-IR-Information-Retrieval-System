Cambridge Colleges

The Colleges are independent, self-governing corporate bodies quite distinct from the University, with their own property and income. Their affairs are regulated by their own Statutes, though these can only be altered after consultation with the University and the approval of The Queen in Council, and they are also bound by some of the University Statutes. The governing body of a College consists of a Master (Provost, President, Principal, Warden or Mistress) and a number of Fellows.

Every Cambridge student must be a member of a College. The most notable change in the Colleges in recent years has been the introduction of co-residence for men and women, and there are now twenty-eight mixed Colleges, and three for women only. The Colleges are responsible for admitting undergraduate students, for the accommodation and welfare of their members, and for individual and small-group tuition. The relatively small scale of the thirty-one College communities and the close personal attention paid to each student's academic career are particular strengths of the Cambridge system, accounting for instance for the University's very low failure and drop-out rate.
