Students and Courses


The University at present has more than 16,500 full-time students - over 11,600 undergraduate, and nearly 5000 graduate. About seventeen per cent of the student body is from overseas, coming from over one hundred different countries. Because of its high academic reputation, admission to the University is highly competitive. Only about a third of applicants are admitted, and most overseas students already have a good degree from a university in their own country. 

The student body at both undergraduate and graduate level is fairly evenly split between arts and science subjects. 

Almost all students are required to study a complete Cambridge degree course lasting two, three or more years, during which they must live in Cambridge for specified periods totalling twenty-five weeks each year. Students are not usually admitted for part-time study, or to follow only part of a course, or to spend a period as an occasional student to gain credits as part of their work at another university. Some part-time degree courses and sessions of short courses are provided by the University's Board of Continuing Education (now Institute of Continuing Education). 

The subjects shown below are taught at first-degree level but some of those listed will only be taught as an option within a broader curriculum or Tripos. It is also worth noting that Cambridge offers few vocational subjects compared to other universities.
