University Finances


With a turnover of over ¡ê250 million each year, which does not include the turnover of the Colleges or Cambridge University Press and the Local Examinations Syndicate, the University's income is derived from a wide variety of public and private sources. These include grants from government bodies as well as funds from companies and charities for research.

In addition, the University established The Cambridge Foundation in 1989 to help the long-term plans and to secure the finance needed. It has charitable trust status with a distinguished board of Trustees from inside and outside the University. Substantial progress has already been made in securing funds for major capital projects and new posts, with contributions from the Colleges, alumni at home and overseas, and the business community. The University estimates that at least ¡ê250 million will be necessary to implement the initial development plans, over ten years. Thereafter, fund-raising will be an integral part of the University's financial strategy.

Full details of the University's income and expenditure is published each year in the University's Annual Report, available from the Press and Publications Office.
