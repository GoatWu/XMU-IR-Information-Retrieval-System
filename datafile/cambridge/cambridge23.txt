Industrial Co-operation


The University has an open and unbureaucratic approach to the exploitation of research discoveries. This has led to what is called 'The Cambridge Phenomenon' and the establishment by Trinity College of England's first science park in the 1970s.

Collaborative research programmes with industry are encouraged and companies gain access to the wide variety of skills and expertise available in Cambridge. Companies are assured of the right to use any intellectual property arising from research they sponsor on terms that reflect the contributions made by both the University and the sponsor. Proprietary information is respected and sponsors are helped to protect new discoveries, although eventual publication of results is the academic norm.

The University's Corporate Liaison Office exists as a portal to promote contacts between the University and industry, and to help academics find ways of commercially exploiting their research results. In 1996 the Institute of Biotechnology was awarded the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement jointly with various industrial companies.
