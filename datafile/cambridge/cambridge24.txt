The Wider University Community


The University is a major employer in the City of Cambridge and much of its expenditure finds its way directly into the local economy. The students of Cambridge are also active in the local community through charity activities.

The University also has a worldwide reputation for other aspects of its work. Cambridge University Press, one of the oldest and largest publishers, and the University's Local Examinations Syndicate, which sets school and language examinations in many lands, have both won The Queen's Award for Export Achievement.

The Fitzwilliam Museum contains outstanding art collections and the University Library holds some of the world's greatest literary treasures and manuscripts. Other museums open to the public include the Whipple Museum of the History of Science, the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, and the Scott Polar Research Institute Museum. Lectures, concerts and exhibitions are often open to visitors and the general public, see http://www.cam.ac.uk/cambuniv/libmuseums/ for further information.

The University keeps in touch with about 140,000 of its former students all over the world through CAM, a magazine published three times a year. The Alumni Office organises the annual alumni weekend each September and graduates can also keep in touch through The Cambridge Society, and The American Friends of Cambridge University.
