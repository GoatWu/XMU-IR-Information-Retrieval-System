The Board also provides International Summer School programmes offering short-term study opportunities to both overseas and British students, with accommodation in Cambridge Colleges.

The Board of Continuing Education also runs, through the Cambridge Programme for Industry, an advanced programme of short courses aimed at practising scientists, engineers and managers in industry and business.

It also generates new contacts and leads to new opportunities for growth and development.
