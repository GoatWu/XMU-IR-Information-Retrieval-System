Using the Sony DSC-P50
 

Record Mode

The camera turns on and warms up in just 2 seconds - very quick. I'm sure the fact that the lens doesn't have to extend has something to do with that. 

When you depress the shutter release button halfway, it can take up to a second to lock focus. When you press the button all the way down, the photo is taken with no delay. Shot-to-shot speed is impressive -- just 2-3 seconds before you can take another shot. Writing a TIFF file takes considerably longer. Unfortunately, you can't even fit a TIFF on the included 4MB Memory Stick, so I can't tell you just how long it takes!

The zoom control on the P50 was silent, and responsive.

The P50 did a great job with the usual macro subject (I should be getting royalties from Disney for this, sheesh). No white balance problems at all -- Auto mode worked just fine for a change. You can get as close as 3 cm at full wide-angle, and 80 cm at full telephoto.

The camera did pretty well in our not-so-usual night shot test as well. The noise level is acceptable (to me) and there aren't any hot pixels, as you can see. This was shot in "Night Scene" mode.

The photo quality was impressive overall. In some shots taken on cloudy days, the images were on the underexposed side. But otherwise, color and sharpness looked good. Check out the photo gallery to judge for yourself.
