The adidas Golden Shoe Award of the 2002 FIFA World Cup? goes to Ronaldo who increased his total to eight goals. Joint second are Brazil¡äs Rivaldo and Miroslav Klose of Germany with 5 goals and 1 assist each. 

Ronaldo¡äs total is the highest since Gerd Mueller scored ten goals in six matches in Mexico in 1970. Ever since 1974 (Grzegorz Lato/POL, 7 goals) the best goalscorer had always totalled six goals.
