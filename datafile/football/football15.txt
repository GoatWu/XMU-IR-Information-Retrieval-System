England confirm South African date
Wednesday 25 September 2002 

England will play a friendly international against South Africa in Durban next summer in preparation for a EURO 2004?qualifying meeting with Slovakia.

Historic friendly
Sven-Göran Eriksson's side will face Bafana Bafana on 22 May as a warm-up for the visit of the Slovakians on 11 June. Eriksson has already stated his intent to take his squad for a training camp to keep them sharp, and the Football Association organised the historic friendly following a long-standing request by former South African president Nelson Mandela.

'Fantastic occasion'
It will be the first time England have played in South Africa, though the two sides met at Old Trafford in 1997, with England emerging 2-1 winners. Eriksson told the FA's official website: "Football is such a popular sport in South Africa and I'm sure it will be a fantastic occasion. We will look forward to it very much."
