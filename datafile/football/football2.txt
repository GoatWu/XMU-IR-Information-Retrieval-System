U.S. debuts in top 10; New Zealand up 41 
Although nearly 50 matches have been played since the end of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, mathematics played a large part in the new FIFA/Coca-Cola World Rankings, which are calculated based on results and statistics from the previous eight years. 

With older games becoming less significant, the U.S. broke into the top ten for the first time, moving into a tie with Italy in 9th. The U.S. has jumped 15 places since January, 2002, and 26 places since its low point in October 1997, when the team was ranked 35th. 

Predictably, World Champions Brazil maintained the top spot on the list, which it held for six straight years from 1995-2000. South American champions Colombia, which did not qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, fell out of the top 10, to 15th.
