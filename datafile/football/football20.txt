Advocaat to concentrate on Dutch role
Wednesday 18 September 2002 


Dick Advocaat is to leave Scottish Premier League club Rangers FC in November to concentrate fully on his role as coach of the Netherlands national team, the Glasgow club announced on Wednesday.

McLeish arrival
The former PSV Eindhoven coach has been director of football at Ibrox since being replaced as manager by Alex McLeish last November.

Murray comments
"Dick Advocaat's achievements with Rangers should not be underestimated in any way," honorary chairman David Murray told the club's website. "His determination in creating training and youth development facilities benefiting our club has created a solid foundation for the future and I thank him for his contribution."

Several honours
Advocaat became manager of Rangers in 1998, winning two league titles, two Scottish Cups and a League Cup during his first two seasons in Scotland.

'Seamless transition'
He moved into the director of football role when McLeish joined from Hibernian FC and the club thanked him on Wednesday for seeing through a "seamless transition". Rangers, who lost 2-0 to Czech Republic side FK Viktoria Zizkov in their UEFA Cup first round first-leg match last night, say they have no immediate plans to appoint a new director of football.
