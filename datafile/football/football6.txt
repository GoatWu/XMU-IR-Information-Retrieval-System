France to fall from top position in FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking 

FIFA YOKOHAMA, 29 June - The series of surprises in the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan(TM) will have a major impact on the next FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking. 
France, the uncontested leader for more than a year, stand to lose their top position after failing to advance to the second round of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Finalists Brazil, ranked third in the May issue and leaders from the 1994 FIFA World Cup to April 2001, look set to succeed France even if Germany defeats the South American powerhouse in the Final in Yokohama on 30 June. The big winners will no doubt include competition sensations Korea Republic and Senegal, who might even become the best-ranked teams of their confederations, as well as other FIFA World Cup finalists qualifying at least for the Round of 16. 

The FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking will be published on Wednesday, 3 July at 10am CET on FIFA.com.
