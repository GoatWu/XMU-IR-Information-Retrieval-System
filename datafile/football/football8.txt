Budweiser Man of the Match 64, GER : BRA ¨C Ronaldo 
  

Ronaldo gloriously vanquished the demons of 1998 in Brazil¡¯s 0:2 win over Germany in Sunday¡¯s final. ¡°The Phenomenon¡± scored both goals in the span of 12 minutes to lift Brazil to their fifth FIFA World Cup&tarde; title and earn Budweiser Man of the Match honours. 
In the first half he failed to score on three great chances, and it seemed that he might forever be haunted by the ghosts of the France 98 final, when Ronaldo played a sluggish match in a losing effort just hours after having suffered an epileptic-like fit. 

But the second half would tell a different story. In the 67th minute Ronaldo won the ball from Dietmar Hamann and then saw Rivaldo¡¯s shot bounce out of the grasp of Germany goalkeeper Oliver Kahn. Ronaldo was on target this time, as he pounced to slot the ball into the net. 

Ronaldo¡¯s second goal confirmed his status as the star of the night. He received a pass from Kleberson at the edge of the area after a perfect dummy run by Rivaldo, took a touch to control and unleashed a shot into the lower-right corner of the net, past a diving Kahn. 

The final numbers are impressive for any man and certainly more so for a player who has spent two years battling back from injuries. Ronaldo won the Golden Shoe with eight goals in the tournament, three more than his nearest rivals, and his two goals against Kahn were one more than the keeper had previously allowed in the entire Cup.

"It's a fantastic feeling to be a Brazilian tonight," Ronaldo said.

"The whole squad has worked very hard. I worked for two and a half years to be here tonight. We are all so happy to have landed this fifth championship."
