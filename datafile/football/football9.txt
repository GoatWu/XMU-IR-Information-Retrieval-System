GER : BRA -- TSG post-match analysis 

"Both teams tried to use their best tools to win the match. In the end, it was the individual qualities of the Brazilian players that made the difference, especially in creating opportunities in the attack, though Germany played a well-organised game and came with the counter-attack. 
Brazil were brilliant in their combinations, especially between Rivaldo and Ronaldo in the second goal, with Rivaldo leaving the ball for Ronaldo, who finished accurately. 

It was a good final. I think it was good for the game of football. The technical abilities on display were very high, and the teamwork of the Germans was a strong component in the match. Some good through-balls by Brazil in the first half weren¡¯t turned into goals, but in the second half when Germany had two good chances and didn¡¯t score, Brazil took over with their individual ability and precise play."
