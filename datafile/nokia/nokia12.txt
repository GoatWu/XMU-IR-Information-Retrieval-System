Nokia Networks to improve efficiency in its professional mobile radio business 

(September 17, 2002) 

Plans personnel reductions of approximately 300 people

Nokia Networks plans to reduce the number of personnel by approximately 300 people from its professional mobile radio unit and from its production unit. The planned reductions are aimed at adjusting the organisation to the current business needs and to the postponed timelines in the professional mobile radio market. Nokia has a strong position and product portfolio in the TETRA market. As the market for TETRA networks has taken off slower than previously anticipated, resources need to be adjusted accordingly. 

The majority of the planned reductions concern Finland, while impacts in other countries are very small. Nokia will start employee negotiations in Finland regarding the planned changes. 

By taking determined action in all areas of its operations, Nokia Networks aims at ensuring long term competitiveness and a healthy cost structure. At the same time, Nokia Networks will retain a strong organisation to support customer needs. 

Nokia Networks employs approximately 19 000 people globally. 

Nokia is the world leader in mobile communications. Backed by its experience, innovation, user-friendliness and secure solutions, the company has become the leading supplier of mobile phones and a leading supplier of mobile, fixed broadband and IP networks. By adding mobility to the Internet Nokia creates new opportunities for companies and further enriches the daily lives of people. Nokia is a broadly held company with listings on six major exchanges.
